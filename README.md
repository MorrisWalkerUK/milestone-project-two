# Milestone Project Two

A mini project to focus on demonstating the use of JiraScript (JS).  A simple set of banking capabilities are used to show logon validation and account validation.

Live Demo (if applicable): Provide a link to the live project.

Repository Link: Include a link to the GitHub repository.

### 1. Introduction

The project focuses on demonstrating the use of JavaScript to complete complex validation.  A couple of simple banking processes are used that most people should be able to easily relate to.  The logon process needs to ensure a password is reasonably complex including a Capital letter, lowercase letters, digits and special characters and be of a reasonable length.

### 2. User Experience (UX)

The user experience is to ensure an adequate password is used.  Error messaging will give the user clues on what the minimal requirement is.

#### Target Audience

Passwording is a universal requirement for beginners and experienced users.  The process is kept as simple as possible and with sufficient error messaging to the user when the password does not meet the minimum requirement of a password.

#### User Stories

Create a table or list of user stories. For each story, include:

As a/an [user type]: What type of user is this?
I want to: State the goal or feature the user desires.
So that I can: Describe the benefit the user will gain.
Design Choices
Summarize your design decisions, including:

Colour Scheme: Not focused on for this demonstration.
Typography: Not considered important for this demonstation.
Imagery: Not focused on for this demonstation.
Wireframes: Not necessary for this simple demonstation.

### 3. Features

#### Core Features

Password validation.  Required in all modern applications.  Its purpose is to prevent unwanted users viewing and/or amending a users private information.  

The password is sufficiently complex to avoid unwanted users guessing what it is.  Historically own name was commonly used such as Morris,  later a number was deemed important, this became Morris1.  So it was easy for an unwanted user to guess a password.  

Today the most common requirement is to insist on at least one capital letter, some lowercase letters, at least one number and at least one special character and a minimum length.

#### Future Features

Passwording is constantly under review, usually due to unwanted users find ways of identifying passwords.  There are solutions that use very random passwords but they need to be saved to be reused.  Other techniques include finger prints  and reading eye cornea.  We have to hope there is eventually a single safe way of identifying a person.

### 4. Technologies Used

#### Languages

The focus is on JavaScript.

HTML and CSS are also used.

#### Frameworks & Libraries

The only framework and libraries used are the standard ones provided by the Code Institute for students.

#### Tools & APIs

This has been a simple programming excercise to focus on JavaScript.  No additional tools or API's were used.

### 5. Testing

#### Manual & Automated Testing

All testing was done manually using negative tests first, which are designed to cause a fail, for example no capital letter, no numbers, no special characters and too short.  Secondly positive tests were made to ensure a pass was achieved by providing the correct combination of characters to meet the validation rules created using JavaScript.  

No automated tests were written.

#### Validation

Mention tools or validators used for:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Other relevant code

#### Known Bugs

The code has been successfully tested.  No workarounds are required.

### 6. Deployment

#### Steps to Deploy

Provide a clear, step-by-step guide to deploy the project. Include details about hosting platforms, configuration, and deployment tools.

#### Hosting Details

Explain where the project is hosted (e.g., Heroku, GitHub Pages) and include any additional details about how it is accessed.

### 7. Credits

#### Code Sources

Acknowledge tutorials, articles, or external code snippets that you used.

#### Media

List sources of media (e.g., images, videos) and provide proper attribution.

#### Acknowledgments

Thank individuals, mentors, or communities who helped with the project.
